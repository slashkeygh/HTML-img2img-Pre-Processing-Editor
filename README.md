**HTML img2img Pre-Processing Editor**

This was developed as a convenient way to prepare images prior to using them as img2img input images for various AI image generation operations.

It includes two tabs, one for **image editing** and the other for **video frame extraction**.

It is kinda janky and not always snappy. It suits my own purposes and that is good enough for me.

**Versions**

1. img2imgPreEditor.html - Includes both the image editor tab and video frame extraction tab.
2. AdvancedRGBNoiseGeneration.html - Older version that only includes an old version of the image editor.

Just download and open the file in a browser.

If you are concerned about safety, feel free to run them through an AI to check them.
